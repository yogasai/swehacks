\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Project Description:\
\

\b0 We were interested in looking at how people communicate through code reviews/comments,\
such as the emotions conveyed through their comments, whether they are written in a more\
passive or direct style, etc. and how these characteristics contribute to the \'93effectiveness\'94 of\
their repository. For example, on GitHub, whose API was used in this project, this would be\
measured by the number of times the repository has been \'93forked\'94, frequency of pull requests\
accepted (rather than rejected), etc. Through analyzing this data we hoped to gain insights into\
the characteristics of effective code comments and how this can contribute to improved communication within a team and as well as better code. \
